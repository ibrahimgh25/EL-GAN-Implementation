# DataLoader

In this module I have an implementation of a dataset (in dataset.py), this dataset is to be used to load the Tusimple dataset found at this [link](https://github.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark/issues/3). You download the train and the dev sets (these will be the train and the test sets for the train elgan).

You then manipulate the root_dir and json files accordingly to run the code properly.
