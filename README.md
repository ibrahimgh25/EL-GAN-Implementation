# EL-GAN
This repository offers an implementation for the Embedded loss GAN. EL-GAN was introduce in 2018 in a paper by Ghafoorian et al., the original paper can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05525).

## Thanks
The repository was built on top of this [repository](https://github.com/baldassarreFe/pytorch-densenet-tiramisu) owned by Federico Baldassarre - the referenced repository offered an implementation for FCDenseNets and DenseNets. I would like to thank the author, whose repository not only helped me for the implementation and getting a better understanding for DenseNets, but also with organizing and presenting a project on GitHub.
